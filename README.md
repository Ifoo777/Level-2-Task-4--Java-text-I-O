# Level 2 Task 4 -Java text I O

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Create a new java file called Poetry.java

● This task is going to be based on your Level 1 Capstone Project II where you created the Caesar cipher.

● Recreate your project from JavaScript into Java.

● Include file input-output functionality in your code so that the program can read a text file, encode it, and output the encoded message into a new text file

● Use your program to read the content of the text file poem.txt. For each line in poem.txt, write a new line in a new text file encodedPoem.txt that is encoded by the cipher.

● Compile, save and run your file.

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Modify your Poetry.java file to do the following:

● If the letter is coded to a vowel, make it a capital letter.

● Write your new encoded poem to a text file called capitalVowels.txt.

● Compile, save and run your file.

## Task 3

Follow these steps:

● Modify your Poetry.java file to do the following:

● Take capitalVowels.txt and reverse the characters of each line of the file

● Then, decode the text back to its original letters

● Finally, write this text to a new file called reversePoem.txt.

● Make sure that the capitalised vowels go back to their original letters!

● Compile, save and run your file.
